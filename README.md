### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**I am Data/BI Analyst, Junior Data Analytics Engineer.

Over the past year, I have been learning data analysis in Python and have gained experience in working with SQL and Tableau. Before diving into these new tools, I used to create sales reports, compile profit and loss statements, and forecast budgets in Excel. At my previous job, I developed a keen eye for detail and backed up my observations with data.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning database basics
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a birdwatcher
